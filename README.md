`SurrogateRank` is an `R` package that uses rank-based nonparametric approaches to evaluate surrogate marker(s) in a small sample size setting.    

More details on the method are available in Parast L, Cai T, Tian L (2024). A Rank-Based Approach to Evaluate a Surrogate Marker
in a Small Sample Setting. Biometrics, 80(1): ujad035.  [doi:10.1093/biomtc/ujad035](https://doi.org/10.1093/biomtc/ujad035). 

The package also implements the nonparametric approach in the high-dimensional setting. Details are described in Hughes A, Parast L, Thi√©baut R, Hejblum BP (2025). RISE : Two-Step Rank-Based Identification of High-Dimensional Surrogate Markers Applied to Vaccinology. ArXiv [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03030](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03030).
