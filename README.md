`SurrogateRank` is an `R` package that uses rank-based nonparametric approaches to evaluate surrogate marker(s) in a small sample size setting.    

More details on the method are available in Parast L, Cai T, Tian L (2024). A Rank-Based Approach to Evaluate a Surrogate Marker
in a Small Sample Setting. Biometrics, 80(1): ujad035, [doi:10.1093/biomtc/ujad035](https://doi.org/10.1093/biomtc/ujad035). 

The package also implements the nonparametric approach in the high-dimensional setting. Details are described in Hughes A, Parast L, Thiébaut R, Hejblum BP (2025). RISE : Two-Step Rank-Based Identification of High-Dimensional Surrogate Markers Applied to Vaccinology. Statistics in Medicine, 44(20-22): e70241, [doi:10.1002/sim.70241](https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.70241). 

Go here to view a tutorial for this package: [SurrogateRank Tutorial](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/laylaparast/SurrogateRank/blob/main/SurrogateRank_tutorial.html).  We also have a shiny app implementing these methods [here](https://parastlab.shinyapps.io/SurrogateRankApp/).
